This design doc was mostly generated by prompting V0 for a style guide, user journeys, user stories, and a component library after getting the front end UI to a good point functionally. The AI prompts used are at the bottom of the document. Every word of this document was read (and edited if necessary) by a human (Geoff ðŸ˜Š)
